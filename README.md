### Hi 

I have used the dataset downloaded fron kaggle for this project.

Here I try to make it more comprehensive project by using python, plotly, quarto markdown, and the libraries of python like matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle's Dubai Real Estate 2024 Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/uae-real-estate-2024-dataset/code), which includes property listings, prices, and area details from Dubai in 2024.
